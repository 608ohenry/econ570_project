TODO LIST:
- Update the SP500 vs Visa_df to use regex, making the comparison more robust
- Look at immigration apprehension data and see if there are any connections to the markets
- Graph the percent of SP500 companies that get the visas - Owen
- Look at why there are no companies recently that had visas (code error or real reason)
- Use a geopandas map to show the cities that immigrants are in - Zach
- Use a geopandas map to show a line from where they came from to where they are - Zach
- Make wanted_chart with the visa progression
- Write about how we could stimulate the market with green cards for undergraduate degree holders in stem or desired majors
- More ideas on how to connect immigration and the markets (think outside the box)
- Find other reliable finance packages
- Add a yf scraper that is timed into a csv so we do not have to pull all the time (this could be in a separate code file we turn in) - Owen
- Ask prof if we can turn everything in that is in the github repo
- Ask TA mitchell next week about what he does for visas (thats his research proj) and see if we can get some advice/data from him
